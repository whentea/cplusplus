Basic construction of C++ programming

**Let's see Guys !**

//We start our body construction note with what we called  with "comment". Begin with two slash, then write down your statement<br/>
//Firstly, declare your header. Like following statement:<br/>
#include <iostream><br/>
using namespace std;<br/><br/>

int main()<br/>
{<br/>
  cout <<"Hello, thie is an invitation for all of u to join studying C++ language programming";<br/>
  return 0;<br/>
}<br/><br/>



__MyNote__:<br/>
This body consists of some programming parts such as comment, header and body program.
Two back slachs give a sign that the statement is a comment that will not be processing by program
Although be statement, yet there is a method in't that no processing will be done there<br/>

Second, you will look a header that begins with # sign<br/>
Remember that include is one of keywords of C++ library<br/>
The "using namesapce std" must declare in your program if you utilize I/O instructions<br/>
Third, we look the body program<br/>
Just a simple state, hello bla bla bla<br/>

Finally, there is a "return 0" statement. Why ? Remember that we use "int main" fucntion. U need a return value as the final feetback of your program<br/><br/><br/>
