## Basic construction of C++ programming<br/>

**Let's see Guys !**

```css
//We start our body construction note with what we called "comment". Begins with two slash, then write down your statement
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
  cout <<"Hello, thie is an invitation for all of u to join studying C++ language programming";
  return 0;
}
```
<br/>
__MyNote__:<br/>
Firstly,<br/>
This body consists of some programming parts such as comment, header and body program. Two back slachs give a sign that the statement is a comment that will not be processing by program. Although be statement, yet there is a method in't that no processing will be done there<br/>

Second, you will look a header that begins with # sign. Remember that include is one of keywords of C++ library. The "using namesapce std" must declare in your program if you utilize I/O instructions<br/>

Third, we look the body program. Just a simple state, hello bla bla bla<br/>

Finally, there is a "return 0" statement. Why ? Remember that we use "int main" function. U need a return value as the final feetback of your program<br/><br/><br/>.
